# III. Concerning the ghost of Robert the son of Robert de Boltby of Kilburn, which was caught in a churchyard. 

I must tell you that this Robert the younger died and was buried 
in a churchyard, but he had the habit of leaving his grave by night 
and disturbing and frightening the villagers, and the dogs of the 
village used to follow him and bark loudly. Then some young men 
of the village talked together and determined to catch him if they 
possibly could, and they came together to the cemetery. But 
when they saw the ghosts they all fled with the exception of two. 
Of these one, called Robert Foxton, seized him at the entrance to 
the cemetery and placed him on the kirkstile while the other cried 
manfully, “Keep him fast until I come to you!"

The first one answered, “Go quickly to the parish priest that the ghost may be 
conjured, for with God’s help I will hold firmly what I have got until 
the arrival of the priest.” The parish priest made all haste to come, 
and conjured him in the name of the Holy Trinity and in the virtue 
of Jesus Christ that he should give him an answer to his questions. 
And when he had been conjured he spoke in the inside of his bowels, 
and not with his tongue, but as it were in an empty cask,[^1] and he 
confessed his different offences. And when these were made known 
the priest absolved him but charged those who had seized him not 
to reveal his confession in any way; and henceforth as God willed 
he rested in peace. 

It is said, moreover, that before his absolution he would stand at 
the doors of houses and at windows and walls as it were listening. 
Perhaps he was waiting to see if anyone would come out and conjure him 
and give help to him in his necessity. Some people say 
that he had been assisting and consenting to the murder of a certain 
man, and that he had done other evil things of which I must not 
speak in detail at present.
