Concerning a certain ghost in another place who, being conjured 
confessed that he was severely punished because being the hired 
servant of a certain householder he stole his master’s corn and gave 
it to his oxen that they might look fat; and there was another thing 
which troubled him even more, namely that he ploughed the land 
not deeply but on the surface, wishing his oxen to keep fat; and he 
said there were fifteen spirits in one place severely punished for sins 
like his own which they had committed. He begged his conjuror 
therefore to ask his master for pardon and absolution so that he 
might obtain the suitable remedy. 


# VIII. 

Concerning another ghost that followed William of Bradeforth 
and cried “How, how, how,” thrice on three occasions. It happened 
that on the fourth night about midnight he went back to the New 
Place from the village of Ampleforth, and as he was returning by 
the road he heard a terrible voice shouting far behind him, and as 
it were on the hill side; and a little after it cried again in like manner 
but nearer, and the third time it screamed at the cross-roads ahead 
of him; and at last he saw a pale horse and his dog barked a little, 
but then hid itself in great fear between the legs of the said William. 
Whereupon he commanded the spirit in the name of the Lord and 
in virtue of the blood of Jesus Christ to depart and not to block his 
path. And when he heard this he withdrew like a revolving piece 
of canvas with four corners and kept on turning. So that it seems 
that he was a ghost that mightily desired to be conjured and to 
receive effective help.[^1]

[^1]: For three nights William of Bradford had heard the cries. On the fourth he met the ghost. And I suspect he must have been imprudent enough to answer the cries, for there are many tales, Danish and other, of persons who answer the shrieking ghost with impertinent words, and the next moment they hear it close to their ear. Note the touch of the frightened dog. — M.R.J.
