Moreover the old men tell us that a certain man called James 
Tankerlay, formerly Rector of Kirby, was buried in front of the 
chapter house at Byland, and used to walk at night as far as Kirby, 
and one night he blew out the eye of his concubine there. And it is 
said that the abbot and convent caused his body to be dug up from 
the tomb along with the coffin, and they compelled Roger Wayneman 
to carry it as far as Gormyre. And while he was throwing the 
coffin into the water the oxen were almost drowned for fear.[^1] God 
forbid that I be in any danger for even as I have heard from my 
elders so have I written. May the Almighty have mercy upon 
him if indeed he were of the number of those destined to salvation.

What I write is a great marvel. It is said that a certain woman 
laid hold of a ghost and carried him on her back into a certain 
house in presence of some men, one of whom reported that he saw 
the hands of the woman sink deeply into the flesh of the ghost as 
though the flesh were rotten and not solid but phantom flesh.[^2]


[^1]: When Wayneman was throwing the coffin into Gormire the oxen which drew his cart almost sank in the tarn from fear. This, I suppose, is the sense of this rather obscure sentence. â€” M.R.J.

[^2]: This is most curious. Why did the woman catch the ghost and bring it indoors ? M.R.J.
