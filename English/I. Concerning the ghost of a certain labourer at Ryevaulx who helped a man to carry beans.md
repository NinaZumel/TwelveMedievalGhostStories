A certain man was riding on his horse carrying on its back a 
peck of beans. The horse stumbled on the road and broke its shin 
bone; which when the man saw he took the beans on his own 
back. And while he was walking on the road he saw as it were a 
horse standing on its hind feet and holding up its fore feet. In 
alarm he forbade the horse in the name of Jesus Christ to do him 
any harm. Upon this it went with him in the shape of a horse, and 
in a little while appeared to him in the likeness of a revolving haycock[^1] with a light in the middle; to which the man said, “God forbid that you bring evil upon me.” At these words it appeared in the shape of a man and the traveller conjured him. Then the 
spirit told him his name and the reason (of his walking) and the 
remedy, and he added, “Permit me to carry your beans and to help 
you.” And thus he did as far as the beck but he was not willing 
to pass over it ; and the living man knew not how the bag of beans 
was placed again on his own back. And afterwards he caused 
the ghost to be absolved and masses to be sung for him and he was 
eased. 

[^1]: So in No. II a ghost is said to appear “in specie dumi” (as I read it), i.e. of a thorn bush. In several of these stories the ghosts are liable to many changes of form. — M.R.J.
