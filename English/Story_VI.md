# VI. Concerning a certain canon of Newburgh who was seized after his death by [blank]. 

It happened that this man was talking with the master of the 
ploughmen and was walking with him in the field. And suddenly 
the master fled in great terror and the other man was left struggling 
with a ghost who foully tore his garments. And at last he gained 
the victory and conjured him. And he being conjured confessed 
that he had been a certain canon of Newburgh, and that he had 
been excommunicated for certain silver spoons which he had hidden 
in a certain place. He therefore begged the living man that he 
would go to the place he mentioned and take them away and carry 
them to the prior and ask for absolution. And he did so and he found 
the silver spoons in the place mentioned. And after absolution the 
ghost henceforth rested in peace. But the man was ill and languished for many days, and he affirmed that the ghost appeared to him in the habit of a canon.[^1]

[^1]: A daylight ghost it seems. The seer and the head ploughman are walking together in the field. Suddenly the ploughman has a panic and runs off, and the other finds himself struggling with a ghost. Probably the Prior had excommunicated the stealer of the spools whoever he might be, without knowing who he was, as in the case of the jackdaw of Rheims. â€” M.R.J.
