# TWELVE MEDIEVAL GHOST STORIES. 

The following ghost stories were published by Dr. M. R. James, 
the Provost of Eton College, in the *English Historical Review* of 
July 1922, in a careful transcript from the original Latin. Their 
connection with Byland Abbey, the appearance in them of well-known Yorkshire villages and names, recommended them for republication in the Yorks. Arch. Journal. They have been translated into English to make them accessible to a wider public than could be 
expected to penetrate the medieval Latin. Dr. James’ introduction 
is reprinted, and also his notes except in so far as they refer to 
difficulties in the Latin. Other notes have been added by Dr. 
Hamilton Thompson, who has also given me much assistance and 
saved me from mistakes in translating the Latin. Dr. Thompson 
has also added a topographical note which he has compiled with 
the assistance of Dr. William Brown. 

The thanks of the Yorkshire Archaeological Society are due to 
Dr. James and to Mr. G. N. Clark, M.A., the Editor of the English 
Historical Review, for permission to translate and print these stories.

## Twelve Medieval Ghost Stories. 

These stories were, I believe, first noticed in the recent Catalogue 
of the Royal Manuscripts, where a brief analysis of them is given 
which may well have excited the curiosity of others beside myself. 
All that Casley has to say of them in the old catalogue is “Exemplaria apparitionum spirituum (saec.) XV.” 

I took an early opportunity of transcribing them, and I did not 
find them disappointing ; I hope others will agree that they deserve 
to be published. 

The source is the Royal MS. 15, A. XX, in the British Museum. 
It is a fine volume of the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, containing some tracts of Cicero and the Elucidarium. It belonged to Byland Abbey (Yorkshire) and later to John Theyer. 

On blank pages in the body of the book (ff. 140-3) and at the end 
(fo. 163 h) a monk of Byland has written down a series of ghost 
stories, of which the scenes are laid in his own neighbourhood. 
They are strong in local colour, and, though occasionally confused, 
incoherent and unduly compressed, evidently represent the words 
of the narrators with some approach to fidelity. 

To me they are redolent of Denmark. Anyone who is lucky 
enough to possess E. T. Christensen’s delightful collections of *Sagn 
fra Jylland* will be reminded again and again of traits which occur 
there. Little as I can claim the quality of “folklorist,” I am 
fairly confident that the Scandinavian element is really prominent 
in these tales. 

The date of the writing cannot be long after 1400 (c. 1400 is the 
estimate of the catalogue). Richard II’s reign is referred to as 
past. A study of local records, impossible to me, might not improbably throw light upon the persons mentioned in the stories. 

The hand is not a very easy one, and the last page of all is really 
difficult; some words have baffled me. The Latin is very refreshing. - M. R. James.

## Topographical Notes. 

The topography of the stories involves a few problems which 
it is difficult to solve with exact accuracy. The following notes 
have been compiled with the aid of Mr. William Brown, D.Litt., 
F.S.A., whose intimate knowledge of the district and its place-names 
has made it possible to suggest clues to the less obvious places 
mentioned. 

I. To judge by the mention of Rievaulx in the title, the locality 
of the story may be fixed near the abbey; but the allusion to the 
beck is too general to afford any clue to its identity. 

II. The scene is on the way from Gilling to Ampleforth, and 
the beck must therefore be the Holbeck, which is crossed by the 
present road from Gilling to Oswaldkirk, just north of Gilling railway 
station. The other places named are “Hoggebek” and “Bilandbanke,” which the hero of the story suggests as places of retirement for the ghost until his errand is accomplished. The nearest stream which can be identified with “Hoggebek” is the Hodge Beck, some 
seven or eight miles to the north-east, which runs through the ravine 
below Kirkdale church and joins the Dove, a tributary of the Rye, 
three miles south of Kirkby Moorside. “Bilandbanke” may be 
the steep hill slope above Byland Abbey, but it may refer equally 
to the side of the Rye valley below Old Byland. In the second case, 
the ghost would have to go about the same distance as to the Hodge 
Beck. Why it enjoyed the prospect of banishment to Byland Bank 
more than to the Hodge Beck must be left to conjecture. 

III. Kilburn and Boltby, from which the Robert of the story 
took his name, afford no difficulty. 

IV. The form “Hereby” points to Cold Kirby, between Sutton 
Bank and Old Byland. The church of Cold Kirby, however, was 
appropriated to Byland Abbey and served by a curate, so that 
James Tankerlay cannot have been its rector. Kirby Knowle, on 
the other hand, which lies two miles north of Feliskirk, at the foot 
of Boltby Moor, was a rectory ; and, although it had no connection 
with Byland, this is no bar to the possible burial of its rector in the 
abbey, which may have granted him the privilege of confraternity. 
The episcopal registers at York do not record one of this name as rector 
of Kirby Knowle ; and of the curates of Cold Kirby there is no record. 
Gormire, the tarn below Sutton Brow, is nearer to Cold Kirby than 
to Kirby Knowle; but this proves nothing. Kirkby Moorside 
might be meant ; but the incumbent there was a vicar, the church 
had no connection with Byland, and the taking of the body to 
Gormire in the opposite direction, makes this conjecture unlikely. 
The use of the form “ Hereby ” by a writer with local knowledge is 
decidedly in favour of Cold Kirby, and the description of Tankerlay 
as rector may be a mere inaccuracy. 

VI. Newburgh Priory, founded by Roger Mowbray for Austin 
canons, lies south-west of Coxwold. The mention of the “master
of the ploughmen indicates that the scene took place upon the 
priory lands. 

VIII. Bradeforth, from which William took his name, is probably a mistaken form of Brideforth, Briddeforth (Birdforth) . Novus locus was most likely on the road between Ampleforth and Byland Abbey. The road ran along or under a hill-side, and the mention 
of cross-roads points to the neighbourhood of Wass, a hamlet which 
has grown up round a cross-roads. The ordinary English word 
translated by "Novus locus” is Newstead, most commonly used 
to denote the site of a monastery: cf. Newstead in Sherwood, Newstead on Ancholme, Newstead by Stamford. Oldstead lies west-north-west of Byland Abbey, and Oldstead Grange marks the site of a grange of the monastery. Oldstead implies the existence of a 
Newstead not far off; and, although the name Newstead does not 
survive to-day in those parts, it is very probable that there was a 
farm or grange of that name near Byland Abbey. It may be added 
that the site of the abbey and its immediate precincts might well 
be called “Novus locus" as distinguished either from the older 
settlement at Oldstead or from the previous sites of the monastery 
at Old Byland and Stocking. 

IX. Ayton in Cleveland is Great Ayton, near Stokesley, 

X. This story seems to come from another part of England, 
if Exon (Exeter) is the right reading. 

XI. The scene of the story is uncertain, and it may have happened anywhere on the way to Santiago. 

XII. The persons in this story might doubtless be identified 
from Subsidy rolls, but unfortunately none of those which would be 
most likely to help are in print. Lond is probably Lund, E.R.; 
but the name occurs in Lund House and Lund Forest, in the parishes 
of Lastingham and Kirkby Misperton respectively. Heslarton is, 
of course, Heslerton, E.R., between Malton and Scarborough.
