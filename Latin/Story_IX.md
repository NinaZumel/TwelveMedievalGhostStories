## IX. Item de spiritu hominis de Aton̄[^1] in Clyueland.

Refertur quod sequebatur virum per quater viginti milliaria qui deberet coniuiare et
succurrere ei. Qui coniuratus confitebatur se fuisse excommunicatum
pro re quadam \[space\]/ sex denariorum \[space\] sed post absolucionem
et satisfaccionem factam requieuit in pace. In his omnibus ostendit se
deus cum nil malum est impunitum remuneratorem iustum et cum nil
bonum a conuerso irremuneratum.
Dicitur quod idem spiritus priusquam esset coniuratus iactauit viuentem vltra sepem et suscepit eum ex altera parte in descensu. Qui
coniuratus respondit Si fecisses sic imprimis non tibi nocuissem † .. ter † [^2]
in talibus locis fuisti perterritus et ego feci hoc.

[^1]: 'Aton', the catalogue suggests, may be Ayton. The ghost throws him over the hedge and catches him as he falls on the other side. So the Troll, whose (supposed) daughter married the blacksmith, when he heard that all the villagers shunned her, came to the church on Sunday before service when all the people were in the church yard and drove them into a compact group. Then he said to his daughter, 'Will you throw or catch?' 'I will catch,' said she, in kindness to the people. 'Very well, go round to the other side of the church.' And he took them one by one and threw them over the church, and she caught them and put them down unhurt.' Next time I come,' said the Troll, 'she shall throw, and I will catch—if you don't treat her better.' Not very relevant, but less known than it should be.

[^2]: The word after 'nocuissem' I cannot read: it ends *-ter*.
