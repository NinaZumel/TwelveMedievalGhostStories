## Twelve Medieval Ghost-stories

THESE stories were I believe first noticed in the recent Catalogue
of the Royal Manuscripts, where a brief analysis of them is given
which may well have excited the curiosity of others besides
myself. All that Casley has to say of them in the old catalogue
is 'Exemplaria apparitionum spirituum (saec.) xv'.

I took an early opportunity of transcribing them, and I did
not find them disappointing : I hope others will agree that they
deserved to be published.

The source is the Royal MS. 15. A. xx in the British Museum.
It is a fine volume of the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries
containing some tracts of Cicero and the *Elucidarium*. It belonged
to Byland Abbey (Yorkshire) and later to John Theyer.

On blank pages in the body of the book (ff. 140-3) and at the
end (fo. 163 b) a monk of Byland has written down a series of
ghost-stories of which the scenes are laid in his own neighbour
hood. They are strong in local colour, and though occasionally
confused, incoherent, and unduly compressed, evidently represent
the words of the narrators with some approach to fidelity.

To me they are redolent of Denmark. Any one who is lucky
enough to possess E. T. Kristensen's delightful collections of *Sagn
fra Jylland* will be reminded again and again of traits which occur
there. Little as I can claim the quality of 'folklorist' I am fairly
confident that the Scandinavian element is really prominent in
these tales.

The date of the writing cannot be long after 1400 (c. 1400 is
the estimate in the catalogue). Richard II's reign is referred to
as past. A study of local records, impossible to me, might not
improbably throw light upon the persons mentioned in the
stories.

The hand is not a very easy one, and the last page of all is
really difficult: some words have baffled me. The Latin is very
refreshing. M. R. JAMES.

[I. De quodam spiritu cuiusdam mercenarii de Ryeuall' qui adiuuit hominem ad portandum fabas.](Story_I.md)

[II. De mirabili certacione inter spiritum et viuentem in tempore regis Ricardi secundi.](Story_II.md)

[IX. Item de spiritu hominis de Aton in Clyueland.](Story_IX.md)

The stories are continued on the last three pages of the volume (ff. 163 b, 164). I omit one extract 'de triplici genere confessionis' and a story taken from a book, of which the catalogue gives this synopsis. A servant guilty of adultery with his mistress, and suspected by his master, is taken to a 'vates qui habet spiritum phitonis', but on the way he repents and lashes himself, whereby the spirit loses his memory. Caesarius of Heisterbach has many such tales.

[X. Quomodo latro penitens post confessionem euanuit ab oculis demonis.](Story_X.md)

[XI. De opere dei mirando qui vocat ea que non sunt. tanquam ea que sunt. et qui potest facere quando et quicquid vult. et de quodam miro.](Story_XI.md)
